columns
=======

Columns is a jQuery plugin that can help you achieve a masonry-brick-like layout in seconds. It's ultra lightweight (only 1 kb!) and is extremely simple and easy to configure. If you ever had divs or other elements that you wanted to be in columns, but they all had different heights, there would be a bunch of gaps everywhere. Thanks to Columns, those gaps are gone.
